(10/07/19) genomics.cpp:
	> Takes in three command-line arguments (.fasta file, .prot_table file, and gene name/ID)
	> Prints out:
		>> Genome statistics from the .fasta file
		>> Gene statistics from the .prot_table file
		>> Gene sequence and its amino acid translation from the user-input gene

(10/07/19) NewtonRaphsonSqrt.cpp:
	> Takes in a float as a command-line argument
	> newton_raphson_iter() calculates the square root of the input value using Newton's method iteratively
	> newton_raphson_rec() calculates the square root of the input value using Newton's method recursively
		>> Recursive function produces segmentation fault for certain numbers

(10/04/19) subsets_.cpp:
	> subsetsI.cpp & subsetsR.cpp
	> Takes in a list of strings from the command line and outputs all possible combinations of the input strings (includes empty set)

(09/23/19) vending.cpp
	> Takes in a command-line argument for a file (ex. vending_contents.txt)
	> Simulates a vending machine
	> Needs work on:
		>> Proper change algorithm
	> (10/4/19) Changes:
		>> Fixed getChange() function (does not work on certain test cases; needs troubleshooting)
		>> Now returns change using getChange() upon "quit" if there is an outstanding balance

(09/22/19) histogram.cpp:
	> Takes in two command-line arguments (file name [ex: wx.dat, temps.dat] and number of desired bins for the histogram)
	> Prints out statistics such as the number of values, mean, standard deviation, and range of values and a histogram
	> (9/25/19) Changes:
		>> Asks user to enter a positive value for the number of bins if the input is 0 or a negative number
		>> Minor changes to format of histogram

(09/13/19) calendar.cpp:

	> Takes in two command-line arguments (numerical month and year)
	> Prints out the calendar for the specified month and year
	> Halloween gets properly flagged on Sundays, Mondays, and Saturdays, but not when it falls between Tuesdays and Fridays
		>> Needs troubleshooting
